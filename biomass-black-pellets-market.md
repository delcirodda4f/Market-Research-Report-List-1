<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biomass Black Pellets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Torrefaction</li><li>Steam Explosion (SE)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The biomass black pellets market includes two primary types: torrefaction and steam explosion (SE). Torrefaction involves heating biomass in an oxygen-limited environment, resulting in pellets with higher energy density and improved storage properties. In contrast, steam explosion uses high-pressure steam followed by rapid decompression to break down lignocellulosic structures, enhancing the biomass's chemical reactivity and energy content. Both methods improve the efficiency of biomass for energy production, offering sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels while reducing carbon emissions.</p></p>
